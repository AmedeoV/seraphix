# 🔍 What is Seraphix?

Seraphix is a **comprehensive secret scanning toolkit** designed for security researchers and bug bounty hunters. It provides multiple scanning strategies to discover leaked credentials across GitHub:

## 🎯 Scanning Capabilities

**🔥 Force-Pushed Commits** - Hunt for secrets in dangling commits created by `git push --force` operations. When developers force push, they often overwrite history containing mistakes like hard-coded credentials. Seraphix uses [GHArchive](https://www.gharchive.org/) data to identify these hidden commits.

**🏢 Organization-Wide Scanning** - Scan entire GitHub organizations without requiring a database. Perfect for comprehensive security audits and continuous monitoring of all repositories within an organization.

**📝 Repository & Commit Scanning** - Target specific repositories or individual commits for focused analysis. Ideal for investigating particular codebases or validating security fixes.

## 💰 Proven Results

This project was created in collaboration with [Sharon Brizinov](https://github.com/SharonBrizinov). Read [Sharon's blog post](https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/guest-post-how-i-scanned-all-of-github-s-oops-commits-for-leaked-secrets) to learn how he made **$25k in bounties** using force-push commit scanning!

# 🚀 Quick Start

## 1: Get the Force Push Database

Download the Force Push Commits SQLite DB via Google Form: <https://forms.gle/344GbP6WrJ1fhW2A6>

This database contains force push commits for all GitHub organizations, updated daily.

## 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
./install_requirements.sh
```

## 3: Scan an Organization

```bash
python force_push_scanner.py <org> --db-file /path/to/force_push_commits.sqlite3 --scan
```

**Example output:**
```
🔍 Scanning organization: trufflesecurity
✅ Found verified secret in repo: trufflesecurity/test_keys
🔑 AWS Credential (AKIAYVP4CIPPERUVIFXG)
📍 Commit: https://github.com/trufflesecurity/test_keys/commit/fbc14303ffbf8fb1c2c1914e8dda7d0121633aca
```

# 📦 Scanner Modules

Seraphix includes three powerful scanning modes for different use cases:

## 🔥 [Force Push Scanner](force-push-scanner/README.md)
Database-driven scanning of force-pushed commits with resume capabilities.
```bash
cd force-push-scanner/
./force_push_secret_scanner.sh --order random --telegram-chat-id 123456789
```

## 🏢 [Organization Scanner](org-scanner/README.md)
Direct GitHub API scanning for entire organizations (no database required).
```bash
cd org-scanner/
./scan_org.sh microsoft --max-repos 10 --telegram-chat-id 123456789
```

## 📝 [Repository Scanner](repo-scanner/README.md)
Targeted scanning for individual repositories and specific commits.
```bash
cd repo-scanner/
./scan_repo_simple.sh owner/repository
```

---

# ⚙️ Configuration

### Notification Setup

Enable real-time alerts when secrets are found:

**Telegram:**
```bash
cp config/telegram_config.sh.example config/telegram_config.sh
# Edit and add your bot token and chat ID
```

**Email (Mailgun):**
```bash
cp config/mailgun_config.sh.example config/mailgun_config.sh
# Edit and add your Mailgun credentials
```

---

# 🗂️ Alternative: BigQuery

Prefer querying yourself? Use our public BigQuery table:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM `external-truffle-security-gha.force_push_commits.pushes`
WHERE repo_org = '<ORG>';
```

Export as CSV and scan:
```bash
python force_push_scanner.py <org> --events-file /path/to/export.csv --scan
```

---

# 📊 Output Structure

Each scanner organizes results in timestamped directories:

```
📁 Seraphix/
├── force-push-scanner/
│   └── leaked_secrets_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── org-scanner/
│   └── leaked_secrets_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
└── repo-scanner/
    └── leaked_secrets_results/YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
```

Results are saved as JSON files with verified secret details, commit links, and timestamps.

# ❓ FAQ

### What is a Force Push?

A force push (`git push --force`) rewrites remote branch history. Commits that were part of the old history become "dangling" but remain accessible on GitHub. Developers often force push to remove accidentally committed secrets. [Learn more](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-push#Documentation/git-push.txt---force)

### Does this contain ALL force pushes on GitHub?

No. We focus on **Zero-Commit Force Pushes**, which are highly correlated with secret removal attempts. These are push events where developers reset history without adding new commits—a strong indicator of attempting to delete sensitive data.

### What is GHArchive?

[GHArchive](https://www.gharchive.org/) is a public dataset of all GitHub activity. We've trimmed it to only force push events, making it faster and cheaper to query.

### How often is the database updated?

Daily at 2 PM EST with the previous day's force push events.
