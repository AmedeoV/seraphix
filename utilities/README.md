## üìä Star Counter Scripts

Fetch and update GitHub star counts for organizations in the database.

```bash
# Single-threaded
python github_star_counter.py [--db-file PATH]

# Multi-threaded (Faster, Recommended)
python github_star_counter_parallel.py [--db-file PATH]

# Default db-file: force_push_commits.sqlite3
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Rate Limit Warning:** The parallel version can consume your entire GitHub API quota (5000 requests/hour) quickly. **Run during off-hours or weekends** when you're not actively using the GitHub API for other tasks.

# Default output: bugbounty_orgs.txt

# Use with force-push scanner
cd ../force-push-scanner/
